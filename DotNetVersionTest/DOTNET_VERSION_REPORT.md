# .NET Version Compatibility Report for GitHub Copilot

## Overview

This report documents the findings of testing which version of .NET is available to GitHub Copilot when working with the `realworld-dotnet-modular-monolith` repository.

## Environment Details

### Copilot Environment
- **OS**: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS
- **Architecture**: x86_64 (X64)
- **.NET SDK**: 8.0.119
- **.NET Runtime**: 8.0.19
- **Base Path**: /usr/lib/dotnet/sdk/8.0.119/

### Repository Requirements
- **Required .NET SDK**: 9.0.305 (specified in global.json)
- **Target Framework**: .NET 9 (specified in README.md and project files)
- **Roll Forward Policy**: latestFeature

## Test Results

### ✅ What Works
1. **Building .NET 8.0 projects**: Successfully builds and runs
2. **Modern C# features**: Support for C# 9+ features like:
   - Pattern matching
   - Nullable reference types
   - Init-only properties
   - Records
   - String interpolation

### ❌ What Doesn't Work
1. **Building .NET 9.0 projects**: Failed with error NETSDK1045
2. **Building the original repository**: Failed due to missing .NET 9 SDK
3. **Using .NET 9 specific features**: Not available

## Error Messages

When attempting to build .NET 9.0 projects:
```
error NETSDK1045: The current .NET SDK does not support targeting .NET 9.0. 
Either target .NET 8.0 or lower, or use a version of the .NET SDK that supports .NET 9.0.
```

When attempting to build the repository:
```
A compatible .NET SDK was not found.
Requested SDK version: 9.0.305
Installed SDKs: 8.0.119
```

## Recommendations

### For Repository Maintainers
1. **Multi-targeting**: Consider adding multi-targeting support for both .NET 8.0 and .NET 9.0
2. **Compatibility branch**: Create a .NET 8.0 compatible branch for broader tooling support
3. **Documentation**: Update documentation to clearly specify .NET version requirements

### For Copilot Usage
1. **Use .NET 8.0**: Target .NET 8.0 for projects that need to work with Copilot
2. **Feature compatibility**: Most modern C# features are available in .NET 8.0
3. **Testing approach**: Create separate test projects with .NET 8.0 targeting for validation

## Detailed Version Information

### Available SDKs
- 8.0.119 [/usr/lib/dotnet/sdk]

### Available Runtimes
- Microsoft.AspNetCore.App 8.0.19
- Microsoft.NETCore.App 8.0.19

### Missing Components
- .NET 9.x SDK
- .NET 9.x Runtime

## Test Files Created

1. **DotNetVersionTest.csproj**: .NET 8.0 test project (✅ Works)
2. **DotNetVersionTest.Net9.csproj**: .NET 9.0 test project (❌ Fails)
3. **Program.cs**: Comprehensive feature test application
4. **run_dotnet_version_test.sh**: Automated test script

## Conclusion

GitHub Copilot's environment supports **.NET 8.0** but does **not support .NET 9.0**. The repository requires .NET 9.0.305, making it incompatible with the current Copilot environment for building and testing purposes.

For projects that need to work with Copilot, targeting .NET 8.0 is recommended, as it provides access to most modern C# language features while maintaining compatibility with the available SDK.
